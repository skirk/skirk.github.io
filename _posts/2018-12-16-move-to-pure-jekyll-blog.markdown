This blog has been powered by Jekyll since the beginning but with a wrapper called [Octopress](http://octopress.org/).
Octopress adds a bunch of helper functions to ease the use of jekyll.

I recently started using a desktop computer as my main development machine instead of my trusty laptop and I wanted to write blogs on the new setup. As I was trying to bootstrap my blog up on the new machine it turned out that the tooling has had several version releases since I last setup them up. Getting the older tool versions was problematic as some of them were already deprecated.

As Octopress seems dead and it imposed some tooling requirements, I decided to scrap that extra layer and 
just stick to a pure jekyll installation. Hence, the site you see now is running purely on jekyll. Also the default theme of jekyll seems nice so I've dropped my previous Octopress theme. Hope you enjoy the updated look too.

Any problems drop me a message via email.
