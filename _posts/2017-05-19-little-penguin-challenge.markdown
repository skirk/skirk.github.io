23rd of Jan 2017 I got my first task for [Eudyptula Challenge](http://eudyptula-challenge.org/) and 19th of May 2017 I received an email for completion of the challenge. I'm the 166th person to complete the challenge, which has now ran for over 3 years and has over 18000 unique participants.  

Overall I spent 4 months completing the challenge, which consists of 20 tasks that cover many areas in the kernel. Some of the tasks were fairly straightforward and some others required few evenings of research before getting my hands dirty. For further details about the challenge I recommend an [article](https://lwn.net/Articles/599231/) published in LWN.

Sadly, if you are thinking of joining the challenge, it doesn't accept new entrants anymore unless you find a way to bribe the scripts running the thing. Best of luck!
