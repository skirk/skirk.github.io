Frequently asked questions:

Q: "Hi, what's your name?"

A: My name is Tuomo. I'm Finnish.

Q: "Cool! What do you do?"

A: I whack buttons to make pixels change colours on the screen. Computer graphics that is. 

Q: "Blimey, how did you end up studying that?"

A: I have always been keen on pretty pictures. My interest in computers and comics took me to Bournemouth to study Computer Animation & Visualisation. I enjoyed messing around with techy stuff so that's what I mostly did. After the undergrad I rolled up on Masters by Research , which meant joining one of the research groups in the university. My research was about making a computer crunch numbers fast in the domain of Functionally Represented models. In this work the focus was mainly in parallel computingas in utilization of multicore CPUs or GPUs.

Q: "Jeez... what are you up to next?" 

A: Right now I'm looking for a job. Software development would be nice, but I don't mind visual effects.

Q: "Nice, what else do you do, as in hobbies and such?"

A: I'm interested in loads of stuff, I try to balance between technical and art stuff. If my job gets really technical, in my spare time I end up doing some drawing and vice versa. Calligraphy is close to my heart as well. On top of that I'm keen on hiking and fishing. I try to do as many long hikes a year as possible. Lately I've also been doing some climbing, it is good fun. Enough talk, who are you?
